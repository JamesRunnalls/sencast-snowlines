James:
CURRENT - Distinguish between NRT and NTC data (OLCI)
- Merge output into single nc file
- PP method integration (Soomets et al.)

Jasmin:
CURRENT - implement post processing filtering of non-physical/impossible values
- fix strange S2 polymer forms when mosaicked (check with a few Lake Constance images)

Dani:
CURRENT - Select bands for datalakes adapter & PP algorithm
- Wavelength metadata for polymer

Minor:
- Flags for mosaiced products are missing -> add some logic to create them
- Masks for mosaiced products are missing -> add some logic to create them
- Implement a logger that writes the log to a file (one file per product group)
- MPH not working for partial products which come from Idepix (date: 2020-04-20, wkt: sui)
- implement CreoDIAS as remote DIAS API (https://creodias.eu/eo-data-finder-api-manual)
- MPH immersed_cyanobacteria is transparent instead of dark blue at zero values (QL)

Newly discovered by Dani:
- if choosing only 'C2RCC' or 'L-FLUO' as processors, IDEPIX is no longer applied automatically
- Repeating a job with the same .ini but different processors will execute the previous .ini saved in .reproducibility
