Environment File
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environment files use the INI format and contain the configuration of
the machine on which Sentinel Hindcast runs. Refer to :ref:`environments`
for details on how to set up your own environment file.

You should create your own environment file for every machine you
install Sentinel Hindcast on.
